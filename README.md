# Machine Learning Algorithms Training

This repository contains implementations and training exercises for fundamental machine learning algorithms. These algorithms are applied to various datasets to demonstrate their usage and effectiveness in different tasks.

## Algorithms Covered
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Means Clustering**

## Repository Structure
- Each algorithm has its own script file containing the model's implementation.
- The files include commented code to make it easy to understand and modify for your needs.

## Usage
To run any of the models, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanjay-mc21/Machine_Learning.git
